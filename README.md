# Proyect 1: Bussiness Landing Page

A landing page is presented as the first evaluation project of Module 1 of the Fullstack Web Development BootCamp. The project was developed with a responsive design in HMTL5 and CSS.

As for the creative idea, it is intended to work as a visual portfolio for an interior design studio to be as clean as possible and with cool colors to highlight the images presented.

Here you can see the simple prototype of the project.
